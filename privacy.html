<section class="section intellectual-property inner-bottom-xs">
    <p>When you use Premier Agents’ services to find, buy, rent, or sell your home or land, get a mortgage, or connect to a real estate agent, we know you’re trusting us with your data. We also know we have a responsibility to respect your privacy, and we work hard to do just that. This policy explains what information we collect, why we use it, who we share it with, and how we protect it, along with the tools you can use to manage your privacy.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>We offer a wide range of services that focus on all stages of land and home purchase lifecycle. We know that everyone’s land and home purchase journey is different, and that deciding on the right place to call home is an intimate, personal experience. Along with a wealth of information about homes or land, neighborhoods, market conditions, local real estate professionals, and financing options, we also use the information you give us to provide our services and help you find your next home.</p>
<p>We carefully evaluate how we use data to make sure that we’re using your information to provide value for you. On this page, we aim to explain everything you need to know about your privacy at Premier Agents’. If you have any questions that we haven’t answered here, you can always contact us at <a href="mailto:info@PremierAgent.co.ke">info@PremierAgent.co.ke</a></p>
</section>
<section class="section intellectual-property inner-bottom-xs">
    <h2>Information collected by Premier Agents’</h2>
    <p>When you use our services, we collect a variety of information from and about you and your devices. Some of this information identifies you directly (like an email address) while some of it is associated with you through your account, profile, or device (like the homes or land you choose to save or your location data). The kind of data we collect about you depends on how you use Premier Agents’ Services. If you only use our services to browse for homes or land, we’ll have less information about you than if we help you buy or sell or if you use any of our other transaction services. Even if you don’t have an account with us, we may still collect some data about you, like your email address and phone number if you choose to contact a real estate agent through our platform, or your IP address and other device information when you browse our sites or use our apps.</p>

    <ul class="loweralpha">
      <li>Information you give us or create using our services<br>
      <p>When you use our services, we often ask you for information about yourself. This usually includes basic things like your name, email address, and phone number. If you use our transaction services, we might ask you for more sensitive data like your income, housing history, and credit score. If you contribute information, such as agent reviews, we’ll store that as well. You may also provide information about other people through our services. For example, if you share a land and home listing with someone, we will collect that person’s email address as part of your account information.</p>
      <p>Below are some examples of what information we collect for our main products and services and how we collect it.</p></li>

      <li>Land and home Search<br>
      <p>When you use Premier Agents’’s home and land search to find a home or land to buy, we give you lots of tools to find your next home and land. If you tell us what you’re looking for, such as the type of home or number of bedrooms, we save that information so that we can tailor your search results to what you’re looking for.</p>
      <p>We also help you connect with local real estate agents, homebuilders, property managers, mortgage loan officers, and other real estate professionals. If you choose to contact one of these pros through our platform, we ask for your name, email address, and phone number so that we can reach you and connect you with the right person.</p></li>

      <li>Services and Products for Professionals<br>
      <p>You may be able to connect your third-party account (such as Facebook, Gmail) to your Premier Agents’ account. If you enable that connection, Premier Agents’ will access your information from Gmail APIs only in compliance with. Google’s Limited Use Requirements</p></li>
